Smart Doctor-Booking & Reminder App
üîñ Project Title & Description
The Smart Doctor-Booking & Reminder App is an innovative platform designed to simplify the process of finding and scheduling medical appointments.

Problem Solved: Patients often struggle with finding the right specialist quickly and frequently miss appointments due to poor reminder systems.

Solution: This application uses a lightweight AI-powered symptom classifier to instantly recommend suitable doctors or clinics based on natural language input (e.g., "earache," "stomach flu"). It pairs this with a robust appointment management system featuring automated, multi-channel (SMS/Email) reminders.

Target Audience: Healthcare providers looking to optimize their schedules and patients seeking a seamless, reliable way to manage their health appointments.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
This project is built as a modern, decoupled web application using a specialized stack to support both rapid development and AI integration.

Component	Technology	Role
Frontend	React (Vite)	Component-based UI for a smooth user experience.
Styling	Tailwind CSS	Utility-first framework for rapid and responsive design.
Backend (API)	Python (Flask)	Lightweight API to handle business logic and connect to the AI model.
Database	PostgreSQL	Reliable, structured data storage for users, doctors, and appointments.
AI/ML	Scikit-learn / Custom Rules	Symptom-to-specialty classification and doctor suggestion.
Messaging	Twilio	SMS integration for critical appointment reminders.

üß† AI Integration Strategy
We are using AI not just for the application's core feature (symptom classification) but also as a powerful partner in the entire development lifecycle to maximize efficiency and code quality.

1. Code Generation
Our primary strategy for scaffolding features involves leveraging AI to quickly produce boilerplate and repetitive code blocks:

Scaffolding: Using the in-editor AI tool (e.g., Cursor or Zed), we will generate React functional components by describing their required state and props.

API Routes: We will prompt the AI to generate Flask route skeletons (e.g., GET, POST, PUT endpoints) for data models like Appointment and Doctor, including basic JSON parsing and database connection placeholders.

Data Access Objects (DAOs): AI will generate the basic SQLAlchemy CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) helper functions based on the defined database model schemas.

2. Testing Support
AI will be used to ensure high test coverage and minimize manual test writing time:

Unit Tests: We will feed the AI agent Python functions (e.g., data validation, reminder scheduling logic) and prompt it to generate comprehensive Pytest unit tests covering edge cases and expected success scenarios.

Integration Tests: For critical API endpoints (e.g., booking an appointment), we will use AI to generate integration tests that mock the HTTP requests and verify correct database interactions.

Test-Driven Prompts: We will sometimes prompt the AI to "Write the implementation for this function based on the following test suite," practicing a prompt-driven TDD approach.

3. Documentation
Maintaining clear, consistent documentation is critical and will be supported by AI:

Docstrings and Comments: The AI will be used to generate clear, standardized docstrings for all Python functions and React components. We will enforce a style standard (e.g., Google or NumPy style) through the prompt.

README and Wiki Maintenance: The AI agent will assist in automatically updating the README.md's Tech Stack section or generating Wiki pages based on new feature additions by analyzing Git diffs and commit messages.

4. Context-Aware Techniques
To ensure the AI generates code and documentation that is relevant and correct, we will provide specific context:

Schema Integration: We will feed the AI the full SQLAlchemy model definitions (e.g., User, Doctor) and the OpenAPI specification to generate tightly-coupled API validation logic (using Marshmallow or Pydantic) and corresponding frontend types.

File Tree Awareness: When generating new files (e.g., a new component or utility), we will often provide the local file tree structure in the prompt to ensure the AI uses the correct relative paths and imports.

PR/Diff Review: In the pull request process, an AI tool will be fed the Git diff to summarize changes, suggest optimizations, and point out potential security flaws or style guide violations before a human review.
