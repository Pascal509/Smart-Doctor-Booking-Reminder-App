## Security Fixes Implemented

### 1. üîê Secure Credentials Management

**Issue:** Hardcoded database password exposed in source code  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Files Modified:** `config/database.go` (lines 30-40)

**Changes Made:**
- Removed hardcoded password "Ezenagu101" from database configuration
- Implemented mandatory environment variable validation for `DB_PASSWORD`
- Added application startup failure if password is not provided via environment

**Security Improvement:**
- Eliminates credential exposure in version control
- Enforces secure credential management practices
- Prevents accidental password disclosure in logs or error messages

```go
// Before (VULNERABLE)
Password: getEnv("DB_PASSWORD", "Ezenagu101"),

// After (SECURE)
password := os.Getenv("DB_PASSWORD")
if password == "" {
    log.Fatal("DB_PASSWORD environment variable is required")
}
Password: password,
```

### 2. üåê Restricted CORS Policy

**Issue:** Overly permissive CORS allowing all origins (*)  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Files Modified:** `routes/routes.go` (lines 19-45)

**Changes Made:**
- Replaced wildcard CORS policy with environment-configurable allowed origins
- Implemented origin validation logic
- Added support for development and production origin lists
- Enabled credentials support for authenticated requests

**Security Improvement:**
- Prevents cross-origin attacks from unauthorized domains
- Allows fine-grained control over frontend access
- Supports secure credential-based requests

```go
// Before (VULNERABLE)
c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")

// After (SECURE)
allowedOrigins := os.Getenv("ALLOWED_ORIGINS")
if allowedOrigins == "" {
    allowedOrigins = "http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:3000"
}
// Origin validation logic implemented
```

### 3. üîí JWT-Based Authentication System

**Issue:** No authentication or authorization on API endpoints  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Files Created:** 
- `middleware/auth.go` (148 lines)
- `handlers/auth_handler.go` (145 lines)

**Files Modified:** `routes/routes.go` (lines 67-85)

**Changes Made:**
- Implemented comprehensive JWT authentication middleware
- Created secure token generation and validation system
- Added authentication endpoints (login, validate, logout)
- Protected all doctor management endpoints with authentication
- Implemented role-based access control foundation

**Security Improvement:**
- Restricts API access to authenticated users only
- Provides secure session management
- Enables audit trails and user accountability
- Supports role-based permissions (admin, doctor, user)

**New Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - User authentication
- `GET /api/v1/auth/validate` - Token validation
- `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` - Session termination

**Demo Credentials:**
- Username: `admin`, Password: `admin123`, Role: `admin`
- Username: `doctor`, Password: `doctor123`, Role: `doctor`
- Username: `user`, Password: `user123`, Role: `user`

### 4. üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Error Handling

**Issue:** Information disclosure through detailed error messages  
**Severity:** High  
**Files Modified:** `handlers/doctor_handler.go` (lines 84, 91, 120, 127, 144)

**Changes Made:**
- Replaced specific database error messages with generic responses
- Implemented consistent error response format
- Removed internal system details from public API responses
- Maintained user-friendly error communication

**Security Improvement:**
- Prevents information leakage about internal system architecture
- Reduces attack surface by hiding implementation details
- Maintains good user experience with clear error messages

```go
// Before (INFORMATION DISCLOSURE)
Message: err.Error(), // Exposes internal details

// After (SECURE)
Message: "Invalid input data provided", // Generic message
```

---

### 5. üìã Secure Configuration Template

**Issue:** Insecure configuration examples  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Files Modified:** `.env.example` (expanded from 10 to 26 lines)

**Changes Made:**
- Removed hardcoded password from example configuration
- Added comprehensive security configuration variables
- Included detailed comments for secure setup
- Added environment-specific configuration guidance

**Security Improvement:**
- Guides developers toward secure configuration practices
- Prevents accidental use of example credentials in production
- Provides clear security configuration requirements

**New Configuration Variables:**
- `JWT_SECRET` - Secure token signing key
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` - CORS origin whitelist
- `AI_SERVICE_URL` - External service endpoint
- `ENVIRONMENT` - Deployment environment indicator

---

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow

1. **Login Process:**
   - User submits credentials to `/api/v1/auth/login`
   - Server validates credentials against user database
   - JWT token generated with user claims (ID, username, role)
   - Token returned to client with 24-hour expiration

2. **Request Authorization:**
   - Client includes JWT token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
   - Middleware validates token signature and expiration
   - User context extracted and made available to handlers
   - Request proceeds if token is valid, rejected otherwise

### Security Headers Implemented

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: Restricted to allowed domains
- `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`: Enabled for authenticated requests
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`: Limited to required HTTP methods
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`: Restricted to necessary headers

---

## Testing & Validation

### Authentication Testing

```bash
# 1. Login to get token
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}'

# 2. Use token to access protected endpoint
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/doctors \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>"

# 3. Validate token
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/validate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>"
```

### CORS Testing

```bash
# Test CORS with allowed origin
curl -X OPTIONS http://localhost:8080/api/v1/doctors \
  -H "Origin: http://localhost:3000" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET"

# Test CORS with disallowed origin (should be rejected)
curl -X OPTIONS http://localhost:8080/api/v1/doctors \
  -H "Origin: http://malicious-site.com" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET"
```
